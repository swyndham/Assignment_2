                <h2>Dinosaur Footprints Found </h2>
                <p>The footprints were found on the Isle of Wight, also known as dinosaur island, on the beach at a seaside resort. The footprints were discovered by Engineers working in the area. The footprints are thought to be from a three toed, mantellisaurus. The footprints were discovered after the Engineers were trying to make plans for improved flood defenses.

                <h2>T-rex Brains</h2>
                <p>There was research that T-rexes might have had “baboon-like number of brain neurons”, due to this it is thought by some that t-rexes might have had the ability to problem solve and even build some type of tools. It is thought by Suzana Herculano-Houzel from Vanderbilt University that with these brains t-rexs might have lived up to 40 years giving them the ability to ‘build a culture’. Though other scientists do not agree with these claims that tyransaurs rexs might have been able to build and use tools.</p>
