                <h2>Iani Smithi</h2>
                <p>The Iani Smithi is a part of the rhabdodontomorph iguanodontian species and lived 99 million years ago and lived in what is now Utah in the United States. The Discovery of this dinosaur was an important find for scientists because it can help them to understand why some species of dinosaurs lived and others didn't. The name of this dinosaur came from the roman god Janus, because Janus is the god of transitions which relates to the Iani because it is thought that it is a link between two species of dinosaur, Tenontosaurus and the Rhabdodontidae. It was discovered in early july in 2023.

                <h2>Vectipelta Barretti</h2>
                <p>The Vectipelta Barretti is a kind of Ankylosaurus that lived around 125 million years ago and was discovered just off the coast of England on the Isle of Wight. This Ankylosaur is more similar to the ones discovered in China rather than the ones found in the UK, the ones discovered in China had more armor than the European ones. That information could tell us more about the movement of dinosaurs during that time period. The Vectipelta Barrett is a dinosaur that is covered in spiky bone-like plates as armor, it has short legs and a wide body to accommodate for the armor plates. it was discovered in june of 2023.</p>

                <h3>Chucarosaurus Diripienda</h3>
                <p>The Chucarosaurus Diripienda is a colossosaurian titanosaur or a titanosaurian sauropod from around 95 million years ago found in Argentina in the southern part of Patagonia. The titanosaurus’ are often huge, even in the context of other dinosaurs, this specific one was around 30 feet long (98.4 feet) making it one of the largest creatures to ever walk the earth. The name Chucarosaurus means “indomitable reptile”. It was discovered around May of 2023.</p>

                <h2>Stelladens Mysteriosus</h2>
                <p>The Stelladens mysteriosus is a Mosasaurid (prehistoric marine reptile) that would have lived during the late cretaceous period and it was found in modern day Morocco. Unlike other mosasaurids rather than having teeth like serrated knives it had teeth more star-shaped, like a phillips head screwdriver. Relating to it’s bizarre teeth the name “Stelladens” relates to the star shaped teeth, translating stella to star and dens to teeth, it’s name means star-teeth, rather on the nose if you ask me. Some scientists say that the teeth of the stelladens could have meant that it had some sort of specialized diet or a specific strategy to capture it’s prey. It was discovered in May of 2023.</p>
